    abstract = {We introduce fast algorithms for selecting a random sample of n
                records without replacement from a pool of N records, where the
                value of N is unknown beforehand. The main result of the paper is
                the design and analysis of Algorithm Z; it does the sampling in
                one pass using constant space and in O(n(1 + log(N/n))) expected
                time, which is optimum, up to a constant factor. Several
                optimizations are studied that collectively improve the speed of
                the naive version of the algorithm by an order of magnitude. We
                give an efficient Pascal-like implementation that incorporates
                these modifications and that is suitable for general use.
                Theoretical and empirical results indicate that Algorithm Z
                outperforms current methods by a significant margin.},

    abstract = {One-pass algorithms for sampling n records without replacement
                from a population of unknown size n are known as
                reservoir-sampling algorithms. In this article, Vitter's
                reservoir-sampling algorithm, algorithm Z, is modified to give a
                more efficient algorithm, algorithm K. Additionally, two new
                algorithms, algorithm L and algorithm M, are proposed. If the
                time for scanning the population is ignored, all the four
                algorithms have expected CPU time O(n(1 + log(N/n))), which is
                optimum up to a constant factor. Expressions of the expected CPU
                time for the algorithms are presented. Among the four, algorithm
                L is the simplest, and algorithm M is the most efficient when n
                and N/n are large and N is O(n2).},
